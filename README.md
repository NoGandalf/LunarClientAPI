This Lunar Client API was patched a few months ago but i really didn't pay much attention to it, Lunar Client developers have patched the bug with the server sided emoting meaning authentication will now be impossible with this API, but i will also not try to find another way as they have their API on their repository (https://maven.moonsworth.com/repository/lunarclient-public/) and they will keep a better job at keeping up with updates than i will since they are making the client. This has been fun and i would like to thank [ThatKawaiiSam](https://github.com/ThatKawaiiSam), [Anvils](https://github.com/kodak) and [pmpy](https://github.com/pmpy) for the support with it.
